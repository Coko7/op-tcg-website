## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. JWT_SECRET Leaked in Git History ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Problem:**
- Multiple JWT secrets were committed to git history and are permanently accessible
- Old secret: `tpxnyJxu+kNg0VtAX8Uh3okRMSJTHkZ11uQspj9LNIA=` (committed, then deleted)
- New secret: `iKPrZW1XIq0Mg02douXHg9emL0G6zyvwEbWB/D3PTIs=` (also committed)
- JWT_REFRESH_SECRET was also leaked: `xPi2W9/rgCiJQo8KBf1bl5Ovlxwuo+ThKB4aZmsQzcc=`

**Impact:**
- Anyone with access to the repository (or git history) can forge valid JWT tokens
- Attackers can impersonate any user, including administrators

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Generated new JWT secrets:
  - New JWT_SECRET: `FzBFWFVLrKP88P/N1y6jri4boJtrw73ATMnnToWyHws=`
  - New JWT_REFRESH_SECRET: `o2w2TwzTSiOrDTxMkM6zZQeS4/d6/8+KEdZe94G9Cno=`
- ✅ Updated `.env` file with new secrets
- ✅ Removed `.env.production` from git tracking
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` to include:
  - `.env.local`
  - `.env.production`
  - `.env.development`

---

### 2. User IDs Exposed in Leaderboard API ⚠️ HIGH

**Problem:**
- The `/api/leaderboard` endpoint was returning user IDs for the top 3 users
- Combined with leaked JWT secrets, this allowed token forgery for specific users

**File:** `server/src/controllers/leaderboardController.ts`

**Impact:**
- User IDs are required to forge valid JWT tokens
- Exposing IDs made it trivial to impersonate leaderboard users (including admin)

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Removed `user_id` field from `LeaderboardEntry` interface (line 14)
- ✅ Removed `user_id` from response object (previously line 72)
- ✅ Leaderboard now only exposes: username, stats, rank, and favorite card info

---

## Additional Security Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

1. **Invalidate All Existing User Sessions**
   - All existing JWT tokens signed with the old secrets are still valid
   - Options:
     - Restart the server (this will invalidate all tokens since they use the new secret)
     - Run this SQL to invalidate all sessions:
       ```sql
       UPDATE user_sessions SET is_active = 0;
       ```
     - Ask all users to log out and log back in

2. **Clean Git History (OPTIONAL - DESTRUCTIVE)**
   - The old secrets are still in git history
   - If this is a public repository or shared with untrusted parties, consider:
     - Using `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove secrets from history
     - Creating a fresh repository without history
   - **WARNING:** This will rewrite history and break existing clones

3. **Deploy New Secrets to Production**
   - Update your production environment variables with the new secrets
   - If using Docker/Portainer, update the environment variables there
   - Restart the production server

4. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity**
   - Check audit logs for unusual login patterns
   - Look for admin actions from unexpected users
   - Monitor database for unauthorized changes

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files to git
- ✅ Use `.env.example` as a template with placeholder values
- ✅ Store production secrets in secure environment variable systems (Portainer, Docker secrets, etc.)

### 2. Secret Rotation
- Rotate JWT secrets periodically (e.g., every 90 days)
- Generate secrets using cryptographically secure methods:
  - Linux/Mac: `openssl rand -base64 32`
  - Windows: `[Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Maximum 256 }))`

### 3. Git Hygiene
- Always review files before committing
- Use pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets (e.g., `gitleaks`)
- Never use `git add .` without reviewing changes first

### 4. API Security
- Never expose internal IDs in public APIs
- Use UUIDs or slugs for public identifiers
- Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Consider adding CAPTCHA to login/register endpoints

### 5. Monitoring
- Enable audit logging (already implemented)
- Set up alerts for:
  - Failed login attempts
  - Admin actions
  - Unusual API access patterns
  - Multiple sessions from same user

## Files Modified

1. `server/src/controllers/leaderboardController.ts` - Removed user_id exposure
2. `.env` - Updated with new JWT secrets
3. `.gitignore` - Added more .env variants
4. `.env.production` - Removed from git tracking

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Leaderboard API
```bash
# Make sure user_id is not in response
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/leaderboard
```

### 2. Verify Git Tracking
```bash
git ls-files | grep ".env"
# Should only show: .env.example and server/.env.example
```

### 3. Test JWT Authentication
- Log in with a user account
- Verify old tokens no longer work (after server restart)
- Verify new tokens are generated correctly
